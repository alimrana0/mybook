# Gilbreath Proof
Used Lisp to create a proof of the [Gilbreath Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbreath_shuffle) which is used in some card shuffling techniques. Use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWHxq7PwM8o) for a demonstration.

Included is a systematic proof that interleaving a list of naturals and a list of symbols will result in a list that alternates between naturals and symbols
